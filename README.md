# Ngram Functions

A collection of functions that are useful for ngram-based work.

### Example Usage

- `python ngram_functions.py -i test_text.txt -n 2` will read in `test_text.txt`, which is short list of Leslie Knope quotes, and generate a new quote. Because this is generated using a Markov chain, there is a chance that the generated quote will exactly match a pre-existing one.
