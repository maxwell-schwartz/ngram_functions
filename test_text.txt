Ron! Hey, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, Ron-Ron-Ron-Ron-Ron, what's going on?
Yeah, I saw her in the courtyard.
Ron, this is a Federal tax audit. You could go to jail. Jail Ron. Ron Jail. Jail Ron. Jail. You could go to jail! Jail. Jail. Jail.
Uh...I...I'm just wondering how long that's going to take because Ron and I have a very important meeting together. It's called the battle royale. It's super fun-
What is going on? Where's Tammy one?
Oh! That's great! And how is that gonna help?
Ron there are some things I want to speak to you about but I'm not quite sure how to phrase them.
I was hoping to speak with Ron alone.
Okay, you know what? Let's cut the crap. Is this audit even real?
You...gold digger! You are literally a gold digger!
Basically we are being attacked by Godzilla, and to beat Godzilla, we need Mothra. No offense.
Listen, we need to break Ron from her spell! Can't you just move your butt around or wear a dress made out of meat?
Why do you have so many guns?
Pour me one too, then. Let me in here! I'm gonna join you and if I win, Ron stays here with us.
I wrote a book. "The First Historical Guide to Pawnee." I wrote it as a reference for myself, but then my campaign advisors said we should make it a big wide release. So we had people contribute, we added pictures, and we removed a lot of my poems and emotional ramblings and pictures of unicorns and here it is!
I was born in Pawnee. I'd stake my reputation on it. I have to tell ya this feels like "Gotcha" journalism.
Oh God not the Gotcha Dancers!!
No matter what you heard ma'am, I was born here.
I am back from where I came from!!
Oh God. I wonder who else was born in Eagleton...Voldemort probably.
Hey Ron, whose club do you think is better? Yours or mine? The answer is mine. Say mine is better.
Come on Goddesses. We just struck a huge blow for equality by proving that we were better than them!
I've taught them too well. I've created a mob of little Leslie Knope monsters. I'm so proud. And a little annoyed. But mostly proud...70-30.
When you work in government, people often suspect that you're anti-business. So I'm throwing a little meet n greet with business owners and I've asked Tom's company to help. Here's my opening line: Hi, I'm Leslie Knope and I'm in the business of being city counselor.
Look, I don't like to throw around the word "butthead" often. If you call everyone a butthead, it kind of loses its impact. But I can say without hesitation that Tom is being a real dick.
Although I've not worked with you professionally, as a private citizen I have personally patronized each and every one of your establishments.
I'm sorry. I know I should be chasing your vote but I stand behind my decision to avoid salad and other disgusting things. And I think I have a lot of support in the community for that.
Despite the fact that this seems like a party for Tom's face, I think it's going pretty well. When in doubt, in Pawnee, slam salad.
Hey! You stole the nipple king! Thanks a lot traitor!
I have a better idea. Why don't you go over to one of your rugs and sit on your own face!?
